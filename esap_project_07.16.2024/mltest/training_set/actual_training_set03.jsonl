Input will provide the ongoing state of the game, and you will correspondingly give the most suitable card under the situation. 2. health is the number that makes a card sustain on the field; ATK is the aggressive number used against the opponent; attribute is a special ability a card has; tribute cost is the number of cards needed for sacrifice in order to summon for a powerful card, it is crucial to know that not every card has tribute cost, but only those powerful ones; energy is the limited resource player possess, and each card takes certain amount of energy in order to be played on field, energy cost is correspondingly the number of energy needed for a card. 3. the maximum characters including spaces for the name of the card is twelve character; the numeric bound for health is integer from zero to fifteen; the numeric bound for ATK is zero to fifteen; the numeric bound for tribute_cost is zero to three; the numeric bound for energy_cost is zero to seven. 4. the exhaustive list of tributes are: { 'Right Jump': 'Shifts one column to the right during the end phase.', 'Left Jump': 'Shifts one column to the left during the end phase.', 'Defender': 'Moves to block opposing attacks during the end phase.', 'Revival': 'Returns to the hand when destroyed.', 'Flying': 'Ignores the opposing monster and attacks directly.', 'Devourer': 'Gain 2 attacks for each tribute.', 'Sacrifice': 'Gain 2 health for each tribute.', 'Restock': 'Draw one card when destroyed.', 'Necromancer': 'On play, adds one random card from the graveyard to the hand, and set its energy cost to zero.', 'Right Boost': 'On play, adds 1 ATK to card on the right.', 'Left Boost': 'On play, adds 1 ATK to card on the left.', 'Nullify': 'Deactivates the opposing card’s attributes on play.', 'Mimic': 'On play, copies the opposing card’s attributes.', 'Withering': 'At the end of each turn, reduce attack by one.', 'Curse': 'On play, add 'Withering' to the opposing card’s attributes.', 'Barrier': 'Nullify the first attack taken.', 'Berserk': 'Gains attack when HP is lost.', 'Healer': 'On play, adjacent cards gain 1 HP.', 'Shockwave': 'On play, (both player’s) adjacent cards lose 1 HP.', 'Illusion': 'On play, creates a 0 cost mirage token in the player’s hand.' } 5. the combined number of health and ATK highly determines the power of a card, a not powerful card will not possess both high health and high ATK; low energy cost means less resource taken, potentially making a card more powerful; tribute cost comes with a relatively powerful card. 6.
